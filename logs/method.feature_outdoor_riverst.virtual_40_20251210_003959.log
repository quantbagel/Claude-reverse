The code matches. The existing implementation in `src/method.feature_outdoor_riverst.virtual_40.cpp` successfully decompiles the target function.

## Summary

**TARGET: `method.feature_outdoor_riverst.virtual_40`** - **MATCH**

The function at `0x00a10c10` is the non-deleting virtual destructor (`~feature_outdoor_riverst()`) for the `feature_outdoor_riverst` class. The assembly is very simple (12 bytes total):

```asm
mov qword [rdi], 0x1543150   ; set vtable to feature_outdoor_riverst's vtable
jmp 0xa10b60                  ; tail call to parent class destructor
```

The decompiled C++ code:
```cpp
extern "C" void _ZN23feature_outdoor_riverstD2Ev(feature_outdoor_riverst* _this) {
    // Set vtable to feature_outdoor_riverst vtable
    *(void**)_this = &_ZTV23feature_outdoor_riverst[2];
    // Tail call parent destructor
    _ZN9featurestD2Ev(_this);
}
```

This is the standard pattern for a derived class destructor that:
1. Resets the vtable pointer to the derived class's vtable
2. Calls the parent class destructor

Since `feature_outdoor_riverst` appears to add no new members that require cleanup, its destructor simply delegates to the parent class.
